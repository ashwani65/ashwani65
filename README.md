👨‍💻 **Senior Software Engineer** | 🚀 **AI/ML & GenAI** | 🏗️ **System Architect**

I’m a curious and passionate engineer who loves building and scaling systems that power real-world products. Over the past few years, I’ve worked in Fintech and B2B SaaS, designing and optimizing systems that handle high traffic, real-time data processing, and complex workflows.

I specialize in backend architecture, API design, and scalable systems, primarily using Node.js, Python, Django, and FastAPI. I work extensively with AWS, Docker, PostgreSQL, and Redis, ensuring reliability and efficiency in production. Currently, I lead the backend development of a B2B SaaS platform, collaborating with product managers, engineers, and business teams to turn ideas into impactful software.

I’m also deeply interested in AI and Generative AI and have been exploring and learning Deep Learning, LLMs, and AI-driven applications to integrate intelligent capabilities into the products. Staying updated with emerging technologies is something I truly enjoy, whether it's in AI, cloud infrastructure, or backend architecture.

I love solving engineering challenges, optimizing performance, and designing scalable systems. If you’re into backend engineering, AI, or just enjoy discussing tech, let’s connect!.
